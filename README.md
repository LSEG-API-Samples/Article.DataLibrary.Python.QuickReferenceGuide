# [The Data Library for Python  - Quick Reference Guide (Access layer)](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/the-data-library-for-python-quick-reference-guide-access-layer)
This is a quick reference guide for the Data Library for Python on different asset types

If you’re new to the library, a shallow dive into LSEG APIs landscape, including the introduction to data library can be found in article Summary of Common LSEG Refinitiv APIs 

How to use the Data Library 
Where to go to figure out the available fields that I can access using the Refinitiv Data Libraries (such as the RD Python Library)?
In this article, we are focusing on using the access layer, which is the easiest way to get data. It provides simple interfaces allowing you to rapidly prototype solutions within interactive environments such as Jupyter Notebooks. It has been designed for quick experimentation with our data and for Financial Coders specific needs. (To learn more about Data Library for Python’s layers: example codes can be found here)
